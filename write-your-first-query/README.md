# Write Your First Query

## Open in Glitch

We'll be working in Google Chrome.

Open the Glitch project with Google Chrome: [Write Your First Query](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/coordinated-freighter?path=index.html)

## DevTools

Click the green Show (Live) button in the header of the Glitch project to open a new window.

The new window has a live view of your project, so you can see what happens as you edit it.

Right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element".

The new panel that has opened up is called Dev Tools.

Click the "three dots" button on the top-right of Dev Tools and select Dock Side > Dock to Right.

Now expand drag DevTools to be nice and big and select the Console tab.


## Write the code

Return to Glitch and start writing.

Switch to the live-preview tab to see your progress!
